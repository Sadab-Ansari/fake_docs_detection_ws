# 🕵️ FakeDocsDetector  

FakeDocsDetector is an **AI-powered web application** designed to detect **fake or forged documents**.  
Users can upload documents of any type, and the system predicts whether they are **real or fake** while providing a **confidence score**.  

⚡️ **Privacy First** → No documents are stored. The model runs securely on the backend server and returns only predictions.  
🎯 **AI-Powered** → Uses Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression) trained to identify document forgery.  
✅ **Accurate & Reliable** → Confidence scores ensure trustworthy analysis for decision-making.  

This project demonstrates the potential of combining **Artificial Intelligence** with **modern web technologies** to solve real-world fraud detection challenges.
